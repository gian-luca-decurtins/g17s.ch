> For a Zürich that stands together.

Since 2022, I have been a member of **Die Mitte Zürich 11**. During this time, I have had the opportunity to meet many dedicated people and gain valuable insights into local political processes.

In 2024, I was elected **Vice President of Die Mitte Zürich 11**, and I am running as a candidate for the **Zürich City Council elections in 2026**.

Professionally, I bring extensive experience from international **IT projects**. In these projects, it was often essential to bring together diverse opinions and find workable compromises — a skill I am eager to apply in my political work on the City Council.

I am committed to:

- Supporting local businesses
- Strengthening connections with local clubs and organizations
- Preserving and enhancing the quality of life for all residents of Zürich

**My Vision:** Zürich should continue to be a city where everyone feels at home – supported by a strong economy, vibrant communities, and sustainable development.
