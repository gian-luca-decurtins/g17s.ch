My projects and experiments.

## Social media test

Who doesn't know it? Adolescents want access to social media. But how can they prove that they have a basic understanding of things like behavior, security, and usage?

That's why I programmed the Social media test. The certificate is valid for one year.

## Bänkli videos

Relax in nature in the evening without leaving the city? I've captured some of Switzerland's most beautiful benches with my 360° camera and posted the videos on YouTube.
